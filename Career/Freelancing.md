O que é:

Basically, freelancing means that an individual is not employed by one specific company in one specific job—but instead is self-employed and works for a variety of clients via a variety of sources, usually online. These sources can include freelancing platforms/websites, personal websites, word-of-mouth recommendations, contract work, and so on.

Freelancers manage their own time, workload, and priorities. They are also responsible for paying their own tax and pension, and ensuring they have enough money to cover holidays or time off sick. They are their own boss, meaning they make the decisions and they control their working life, deciding when, where, and how they want to work.

Many freelancers work from home, from freelancing hubs (workplaces for freelancers), or from coffee shops. However, it’s possible to work from anywhere in the world, since the work is often online. I have done freelance work while sitting on a beach in the past!

Types of freelancers:

- Independent contractor: They do supplemental and contract work on a per-project basis. Many think of independent contractors when the word “freelance” is mentioned.

- Moonlighter: They’ve got a full-time job and also a “[side hustle](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/make-money/five-side-hustles-even-your-grandma-could-try/)” — like a salaried engineer who takes on consulting assignments on the weekend, or a teacher who tutors after school.

- Diversified worker: Part traditional employee and part freelancer, diversified employees split their time between part-time jobs and at-will work. These types of freelancers are becoming more popular as on-demand service apps take off. A diversified worker, for instance, might work 20 hours per week as an office administrator and another dozen or so delivering goods for services like [Postmates](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/_go/1407866871/) or [TaskRabbit](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/_go/1409459196/).

- Temporary worker: Most of us are familiar with this subset. Temps have either a single, traditional job, or a contract position for a predetermined period of time, like a web designer who works for three months at a soon-to-launch startup.

- Freelance business owner: Think of this as a freelancer’s freelancer. Imagine a successful freelance dog-walker that needs to expand her business to meet rising demand, so she hires additional freelance dog walkers.

Pontos negativos:

- Job security and income aren’t guaranteed: You enjoy more freedom and flexibility than your traditionally employed counterparts, but you’re also more vulnerable to inconsistent work and economic downturns. Often times, you’re at the mercy of your client’s budget, so you should definitely try to work for multiple clients instead of relying on one. All of these factors make it difficult to chart a monthly budget. An unsteady income is [a concern for three-quarters of freelancers](http://www.slideshare.net/upwork/2015-us-freelancer-survey-53166722/1).

	“The very first question I would ask myself is: Am I motivated to work long days and to go all the way to get jobs done, seek new clients and work? Am I willing to go the extra mile to achieve what I want?” [writes freelance designer Veerle Pieters](http://millo.co/freelancing-advice-from-successful-designers).

- Not every hour is billable: Full-time employees are paid for every hour they’re at work. The same isn’t true for freelancers. Managing clients, finding new jobs, and billing can take dozens of hours a week to complete — time you’re not being paid for.

- No employer benefits: While full-time employees typically have a large portion of their health insurance paid by an employer, freelancers don’t enjoy that luxury. You’re responsible for finding and paying for your [own coverage](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/insurance/health/best-health-insurance-companies/), and individual plans can be costly. It’s no wonder that the cost of health insurance is a [major concern for 44% of freelancers](http://www.slideshare.net/upwork/2015-us-freelancer-survey-53166722/1). You don’t get paid sick leave or vacation. If you miss a day of work, you simply don’t make money that day, and that stinks.

- Increased financial due diligence: You need a head for business, especially when it comes to finances and expenses. It’s not just about taxes; you also have to learn about accounting, billing, licensing, and contracts. All of that extra work can be tough if you’re slammed during work hours with freelance projects.

Construir uma marca:

Here’s what’s next on your to-do list: Create a useful online portfolio, master content and social media marketing, and learn how to recognize networking opportunities.

- Portfolio: Stock them with case studies and testimonials, and remember to publish all quantifiable results and key performance indicators (KPIs) accomplished. If you’re a creative professional, you should include the ways your services have improved your clients’ businesses. Free portfolio builders, including Crevado and Coroflot.

- Embedding and content creation: Once you’ve set up a base, you’ll want to raise your profile in the right places. The social media stalwarts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, etc.) should be on your mind, but you’ll need to burrow deeper to reach influencers who are close to the action. Para desenvolvedores, algumas outras opções são

- Stack Overflow; 
- Linkedin;
- GitHub;

- Another way to boost your brand’s presence is to create content, such as blog posts on your site or contributed essays on other blogs or publishing platforms. Owned content helps optimize your search rank and bring new clients to your site, while contributed content exposes your work to new audiences. 

Networking: 

>“The very first thing I did when deciding to make the switch was to get in touch with every single person I have ever known and told them my decision,”
 
>“The more experience, contacts, and references you have when you go freelance, the easier making that final break from your job will be,”
  
Online, use EventBrite and Meetup to find professional events and offline get-togethers in your area use a low-cost business card service like VistaPrint to print a business card that includes your email and portfolio’s web address.

- Pricing and money: There are several pricing methodologies: cost-plus pricing, market-based pricing, and value-driven pricing. What you pick will affect whether you charge by the hour, month, or project.

- Cost-plus pricing: Você baseia seu valor por hora tendo em mente o quanto você gasta no mês, mais uma margem para outros gastos

- Market-based pricing: This is when you check out what others in your field are charging to find the market price. If you offer more services, charge more than market. If you offer less, your services would be cheaper.

- Value-driven pricing:The final pricing methodology is value-driven pricing. This involves basing your fee on the value of the piece to your clients rather than what it costs to produce.

- Be forthcoming with your client and make sure the terms of payment are stated clearly in the contract — before any works starts. Make clear How you’ll be paid, when you’ll be paid, and what the penalty is for late payments.

- You can use FreshBooks, PayPal and Wave

- While freelancing can be tremendously liberating, it also requires you to be more responsible with your personal and business finances.

- Price too low, you may suggest your work doesn't have value and you might not earn enough. Price too high, and you may not have people willing to pay you.

- Whether you decide to go just by your name, “Jane Smith Writer,” or incorporating a business name, “Elite Website Design,” you should create a brand for yourself. Besides your business name, you should also have a logo that can be placed across multiple mediums. If you use your name, your logo could simply be your initials in an unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices

- Freelancers mostly also do a little cold e-mailing. It may be a little awkward at first, and it may not be the most effective, but it’s a necessary evil. Just search for the names of around 5-15 potential clients that you would want to work for, do a little digging, and find out how you can help them. Then reach out to them through an email. You may have to submit a contact form or message on Facebook if you can’t locate an email address.

- Working for free is a great way to build your portfolio, jumpstart your freelance career, and interest potential clients into giving your services a chance. But, if you’re willing to give your services away for free, why not put them to good use by helping out a non-profit? For example, you could use your coding skills to build a mobile app for a non-profit. Not only does this add to your portfolio, the board of directors for the non-profit could be impressed with your skills and hire you for another job.

Proposals and dealing with clients:

For proposals, mass-spamming your portfolio, or incomplete project ideas sent to people you really don’t know, isn’t the best way to sell your services.

Before you submit an idea to a client, make sure you understand their goals and challenges. You can find out by taking them out for coffee or scheduling a brief phone call.

Next, ask if they’d like to see some ideas you have that could boost their business. If they say yes, it’s time to get that digital proposal together. Include the following:

- Approach: If you’ve already acquainted yourself with a prospective client, there’s no need to enumerate your bona fides again. Remember: This proposal is meant to address the company’s needs. So, right off the bat, list the goals for the project and describe what accomplishing them will do for your client’s business. And discuss how you’ll tackle these objectives.

- Timeline: Be clear about what will be delivered, when, and how. Don’t forget to slot time for revisions.

- Budget: You need to be frank with clients about costs. Clients don’t want to see extra fees after the contract’s been signed. Tell them what the fee will be and how it all breaks down.
 
- Cover letter: This is your opportunity to sell yourself. Tell your client why you’re the most qualified person for the job. Briefly describe two to three similar projects you’ve worked on, the goals, how you accomplished them, and the results (give ’em data if you’ve got it). Remember: This part is more of a case study than a resume.

- Resources: [Proposify](https://www.proposify.biz/) and [Bidsketch](https://www.bidsketch.com/) can give your proposals a visual leg-up. They’ll also help you tackle the peskier sections of your proposal like budget tables and terms and conditions.

- Don’t apply indiscriminately: Copying and pasting your resume to apply to as many jobs as possible is a waste of time. Clients can sense the insincerity instantly. Far better to take your time, find projects where you have a competitive advantage, and write a unique cover letter.

- Do set out lots of lures: You never know what work platform is best for you. Create lots of profiles and see which ones earn you consistent, paying work.

- Say yes and learn how to do it later: Many frameworks and languages can be learned on the fly. Don’t assume you aren’t qualified – take projects where you’re essentially being paid to learn.

- Sales often involves sending a written pitch and, possibly, a talking on the phone. People want to know they’re buying from someone trustworthy. To stand out from other applicants, send a personal video with your pitch (I use GoVideo, a free Chrome extension).

- Tools for getting your agreement signed: You can send a PDF and ask them to print it out and sign it, but that takes time. I find that it’s worth it to pay for an e-signature service such as DocuSign or EchoSign to get things settled quickly.

- Always charge a 1/2 deposit up-front, especially with new clients. This protects you from clients that don’t know what they want, or who change their mind. If a client is hesitant to pay a deposit, you should be hesitant to work with them.

- Learn when to charge by project or by hour. If the project has a known solution and you’ve done it before, consider charging by the project. Every employer has an idea of what’s a “fair” hourly wage but no idea what’s “fair” for, say, debugging an Android app. It could be worth a lot to them, and you’ll be able to charge more. If the project is a big unknown and likely to drag on, however, protect yourself by charging hourly.

- Be reliable: Be a reliable communicator, and answer emails and questions promptly. Also, avoid letting your clients wonder what you’ve been up to by sending regular status reports and/or letting them know when you achieve a goal.

- Be honest: Don’t lie, and always keep your word. Don’t make promises if you know you aren’t going to fulfil them. For example, don’t promise to implement a certain feature at the end of the project, if you already know that you will have troubles completing the project within the estimated deadlines, without that feature.

- Don’t hide problems: Notify your clients of any problems as soon as possible, if the problem is serious and/or is going to emerge anyway, sooner or later.

- Keep track of your time: Keep track of your time, and share it regularly with your clients, if you’re paid by the hour. If you work on a flat rate per project instead, it can help you figure out the difference between estimation and actual effort.

- Offer technical advice: If you notice clients making a wrong technical decision, be sure to point that out to them rather than letting them flounder. Debate the decision, but remember that, in the end, the client always has the final word.

- Ask questions: Don’t be afraid to ask questions; this can save you and your clients much headache down the road. In case of doubt, always ask, and avoid solving ambiguities based on what you think the client wants. When a requirement is not properly defined, or is missing important details, ask her to provide more details, or give her your version, so she can immediately spot any mistake.

- Deliver what your clients expect, rather than what you think they expect: In software development, there’s often an expectation gap—the difference between what clients expect and what they really get. Eliminating ambiguities and avoiding assumptions when something has gone unspecified are good ways to minimize that gap.

- I’ve been asked several times to sign an NDA before being shown any details about the project. And I always refuse, at the risk of losing the project. Why? The problem is, how can I sign a non-disclosure agreement, binding myself to confidentiality, non-competition and so forth, when I don’t know what it is I’d be protecting? What if I’ve already worked on projects that conflict with the NDA?

- Let’s also have a word about dealing with the dreaded trouble clients. The best way to handle these type of clients is by avoiding them in the first place. You can do this by keeping an eye out for the following:

- Clients who are only concerned with protecting themselves legally. If the contract appears to be too much in their favor, then this is someone who could be a headache.

- Clients who ask the question, “If I don’t like this, do I still have to pay for it?”

- A client who claims that they have had a terrible experience with a freelancer in your field in the past.
