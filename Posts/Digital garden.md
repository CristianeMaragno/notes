A digital garden is meant for a knowledge building approach that creates meaningful experiences and understandings, Mike Caulfield â€“ the original source of the concept of digital gardening - presents how this method of note taking can be interesting for bringing the ideia of a web of insights that can be seem from multiple perspectives, rather than what is mainly used currently, what he calls *streams*

>In other words, the Stream replaces topology with serialization. Rather than imagine a timeless world of connection and multiple paths, the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the center.

He sees the current web being widely used for expression, rather than a tool for thought. And while none of the are really wrong, the second reason is not as explored as it should. The Memex, vision of Vannevar Bush, is closer to the idea of what a digital garden aspires to be

>The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.

The curious exploration of what captivates our attention and the systematic recording and connection to other concepts that we know can be a powerful way to estimulate self awareness and creation of value. Nassim Taleb says something similar to this in the book Antifragile: Things tha Gain from Disorder

>I found that anything I selected myself would be read by me with more depth and breadth - because it was a match for my curiosity.

>And you find gold, so to speak, without any effort, as in rational (but not directed) research based on trial and error. It's just like options, trial and error, getting stuck in a rut, forking out when necessary, but maintaining a sense of broad freedom and opportunism. Trial and error is freedom.

This reflection was what made me build this website seeking to achieve what I find most enchanting about the concept of digital garden:
- Construction of knowledge
- Creating meaningful relationships between subjects
- Sharing content with the world
- Personal encouragement to learn
