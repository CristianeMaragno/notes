My favorite quotes on the book The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master, written by Andy Hunt e Dave Thomas

The book has a focus on intentional action, encouraging the readers to search for improvements constantly.

> Never run on auto-pilot. Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time. Over the long term, your time investment will be repaid as you and your team become more efficient, write code that's easier to maintain, and spend less time in meetings.

> it is equally unprofessional to promise impossible time scales and to cut basic engineering corners to meet a deadline. The scope and quality of the system you produce should be specified as part of that system's requirements.

Being a good developer goes beyond just making things works and naming variables well, it's about understanding the real needs of costumers, planing and building a system that is robust, easy to maintain and flexible against a constant flow of changes.

>Also ask yourself how decoupled your design is from changes in the real world. Are you  using a telephone number as a customer identifier? What happens when the phone  company reassigns area codes? Don't rely on the properties of things you can't control.

> While many people try to keep their code flexible, you also need to think about maintaining  flexibility in the areas of architecture, deployment, and vendor integration 
> 
> If you keep decisions soft and pliable, it won't be hard at all. If you have poor encapsulation, high coupling, and hard-coded logic or parameters in the code, it might be impossible.

> In order to keep up with today's near-frantic pace of change, we need to make every effort to write code that's as loose—as flexible—as possible. 

We should't be afraid of the different tools available, they just amplify our potential.

>Tools amplify your talent. The better your tools, and the better you know how to use them,  the more productive you can be. Start with a basic set of generally applicable tools. As you  gain experience, and as you come across special requirements, you'll add to this basic set. 

>Like the craftsman, expect to add to your toolbox regularly. Always be on the lookout for better ways of doing things. If you come across a situation where you feel your current  tools can't cut it, make a note to look for something different or more powerful that would have helped.
