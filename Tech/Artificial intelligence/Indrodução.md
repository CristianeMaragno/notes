#### AI x Machine learning x deep learning

***Artificial intelligence:*** É uma definição ampla que envolve desde tarefas simples até o deep learning. De forma geral  

>"Any device that perceives its environment and takes action in order to maximize its possibilities of success"

***[[Machine learning]]:*** De forma geral é a prática de usar algoritmos para coletar dados, aprender com eles e então fazer uma determinação ou  
predição sobre alguma coisa no mundo. Ao invés de implementar as rotinas de software específico de instruções, a máquina é "Treinada" usando uma quantidade grande de dados e algoritmos que dão a ela a habilidade de aprender a executor uma tarefa.

***Deep learning:*** E a evolução do ML e é inspirado pelos pelos padrões de processamento de informações encontrados no cérebro humano.
Uma das distinções que podem ser usadas entre DL e ML é que o primeiro automaticamente descobre os parâmetros para serem usados para uma classificação, o segundo requer que estes sejam providos manualmente.

Most deep learning  methods use neural network architectures, which is why deep learning models are often referred to as deep neural networks. The term "deep" usually refers to the number of hidden layers in the neural network. Traditional neural networks only contain 2-3 hidden layers, while the deep ones can have as many as 150.  

#### Components of ml

- Representation: How to represent knowledge.  
	Decision Trees, sets rules, instances, graphical models, neural networks, support vector machines, model ensembles and  others. 

- Evaluation: The way to evaluate candidates (hypotheses)
	Accuracy, prediction and recall, Squared error, likelihood, posterior probability, cost, margin, entropy  K-L divergence and others.  
  
- Optimization: The way candidate programs are generated. Known as search process.
	Combinacional optimization, convex  optimization and constrained optimization.

#### Types of learning algorithms
The Types of ML algorithms differ in  the approach, the type of data they input and output and the type of task or problem they are intended to solve.

**Supervised leaning**
A mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the  
inputs and the desired outputs(Training data)

- Classification: Used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values. The output is a category like "red" or "blue"
- Regression: Used When the output may have any numerical value within a range such as  "Weight" and "Height"

**Unsupervised learning**
Take a set of data that contains only inputs and find structure in the data

- Clustering: When you want to  
discover the inherent grouping in the data, such as grouping customers
by purchasing behavior.
- Association: When you want to discover rules that describe large portions of data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y

**Reinforcement learning**
Learns by  
interacting with its environment. The agent receives rewards by for performing correctly and penalties for performing incorrectly.

#### Models
Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions.

- Artificial neural networks: An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called "artificial neurons", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like synapses in a biological brain can transmit information, a "signal", from one artificial neuron to another.

- Decision trees: Uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in The branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).

- Support vector machines: SVMs,  also know as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification  and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging  to one of two categories, an SVM  training algorithm builds a model that predicts wether a new example falls into one category or the other.

- Bayesian networks: A Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A BN could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.

- Genetic algorithms: A GA is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection,using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.
