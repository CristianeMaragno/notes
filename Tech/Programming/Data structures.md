Why we need data structures like lists, trees, etc?

In the book of Thomas A. Sandish, Data Structures, Algorithms and software pronciples, he says

> Assisting the human mind in dealing with complexity and software economics - the problem of how to build reliable, efficient systems as cheaply and rapidly as possible.

Is important to understand the size of our solution, as for different magnitudes of software has different needs. You can clasify as 
- Programming-in-the-small
- Programming-in-the-large

**Linked lists**
Useful when we don't know the size of what we want, so the computer doesn't have to relocate the entire list when it runs out of space.
